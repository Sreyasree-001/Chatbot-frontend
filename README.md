🔐 Authentication Flow
User registers or logs in

JWT token is saved in localStorage

Token is sent in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for authenticated requests

Chatbot greets the user by name and offers suggestions

📦 Sample API Call with Token
axios.get(`${API_URL}/products`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
